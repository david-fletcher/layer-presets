<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/DISzizCxns1dlKuKgo/giphy.gif" width="100%">

An Aseprite extension that allows you to create and save your own layer presets to be loaded into your projects!

## How to Use Layer Presets

1. Download this extension by visiting the releases page! (Double click the extension once downloaded to install)
2. In Aseprite, select `Layer > New... > Open Layer Presets...`
3. Use the dialog windows to construct, save, and open your saved layer presets!

**NOTE:** Due to limitations, the extension only supports 15 layers per preset currently. I have some ideas for future work that could be done to remove this limitation entirely, but given time constraints, we did not choose to implement this feature at this time. Depending on demand, I will circle back around to it. If you need more than 15 layers in a preset, please reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fletchmakes).

## What is a Layer Preset?

A _layer preset_ is a name given to a collection of layers that can be saved, and then loaded into your future projects. For example, consider a character animation workflow. The artist might commonly use separate layers for the head, body, front arm, front leg, back arm, and back legs, to assist with animation and design. This extension allows the artist to define those layers with properties such as layer name, opacity, blend mode, and color, and then load those exact layers into any project they like with the click of a button.

### What Can I Do In Layer Presets?

I'm glad you asked! You can:
* Create a layer preset
* Edit an existing preset
    * Re-order layers
    * Change layer information, like name, opacity, blend mode, and color
* Duplicate an existing preset to modify
* Delete a preset
* Load presets into your project **above** or **below** your current layers
